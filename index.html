        <p>Some day I want to paint this painting. I want to become a real artist. Painting has been a hobby I have embraced for quite some time. Ever since I took the paintbrush and just crafted something on paper, I have never looked back on it. Painting has been a hobby that gives me joy because I can draw my imaginations into an art piece and make the best out of it.My mother was so amazed by the paintings.My mother told me that I was getting better with each stroke of the brush and my biggest strength was the way I observed things. The words motivated me to work harder and make beautiful paintings. My paintings was a great success and my hobby of painting had become a passion to me.
